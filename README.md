# trajectoryLearning
MATLAB code for training an agent to intercept a target in a spatial arena

The script main.m loads auxiliary functions associated with the
primary learning algorithm. It uses these and other functions to load
pre-stored parameters values and build data structures that specify the
properties of the spatial environment, training protocol, and agent.

As specified in main.m, the follow data structures must be constructed before
running the learning algorithm: 

      arena:      properties of the spatial environment
      
      belief:     properties of the agent's belief about the environment
      
      sampler:    properties that specify how the agent samples new anchor     
                      points to guide trajectories through the environment
                      
      planner:    properties that specity how the agent plans a trajectory 
                      through the set of sampled anchor points    
                      
      trial:      properties that specify the training protocol, including
                      target and obstacle locations 
                      
Once the data structures above have been constructed, a single agent can
be generated by running:

      res = runLearning(arena,belief,sampler,planner,trial);
      
The output structure 'res' contains the results from the training
protocol, including beliefs, planned and executed trajectories, and 
outcomes of executed trajectories.

To plot the results from an example agent, load and run the following functions:

      plotParams = loadPlotParams('white');
      agent = load('exampleAgent.mat');
      trialID = 2;
      plotSingleTrial(agent.res,agent.arena,agent.belief,agent.trial,trialID,plotParams);
