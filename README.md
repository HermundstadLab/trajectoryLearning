# trajectoryLearning
MATLAB code for training an agent to intercept a target in a spatial arena

The script main.m describes how to build and train an agent in different
simulated environments.  It first builds data structures that specify the 
properties of the spatial environment, training protocol, and agent. As 
described in main.m, the following data structures must be constructed 
before running the learning algorithm: 

      environment:      properties of the spatial environment
      agent:            properties of the agent, including:
      agent.belief:     properties of the agent's belief about the environment
      agent.sampler:    properties that specify how the agent samples new anchor     
                            points to guide trajectories through the environment      
      agent.planner:    properties that specity how the agent plans a trajectory 
                            through the set of sampled anchor points           
      trial:            properties that specify the training protocol, including
                            target and obstacle locations 
                      
These can be generated by running:
[agent,environment] = generateEnvironment('default');
agent               = generateAgent(agent,'default');
trial               = generateTrialStructure(environment,'singleTarget');

Once the data structures above have been constructed, a single agent can
be generated by running:

      singleAgentResults = runLearning(agent,trial);
      
The output structure 'singleAgentResults' contains the results from the
ttraining protocol, including beliefs, planned and executed trajectories,
and outcomes of executed trajectories.

To plot a single trial from the example agent above, run the following:

      plotParams = loadPlotParams('whiteBG');
      trialID = 2;
      plotSingleAgentResults_singleTrialEvolution(singleAgentResults,...
            environment,agent,trial,trialID,plotParams)
