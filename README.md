# trajectoryLearning
MATLAB code for training an agent to intercept a target in a spatial arena

The script main.m describes how to build and train an agent in different
simulated environments.  It first loads auxiliary and plotting functions 
associated with the primary learning algorithm, and uses these to build 
data structures that specify the properties of the spatial environment, 
training protocol, and agent. As described in main.m, the following data 
structures must be constructed before running the learning algorithm: 

      arena:      properties of the spatial environment
      belief:     properties of the agent's belief about the environment
      sampler:    properties that specify how the agent samples new anchor     
                      points to guide trajectories through the environment      
      planner:    properties that specity how the agent plans a trajectory 
                      through the set of sampled anchor points           
      trial:      properties that specify the training protocol, including
                      target and obstacle locations 
                      
Once the data structures above have been constructed, a single agent can
be generated by running:

      res = runLearning(arena,belief,sampler,planner,trial);
      
The output structure 'res' contains the results from the training
protocol, including beliefs, planned and executed trajectories, and 
outcomes of executed trajectories.

To plot the results from an example agent, run the following:

      plotParams = loadPlotParams('white');
      agent = load('exampleAgent.mat');
      trialID = 2;
      plotSingleTrial(agent.simResults,agent.arena,agent.belief,agent.trial,trialID,plotParams);
